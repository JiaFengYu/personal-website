            <p className="text-gray-200">
              If you've ever built your own PC, especially if you've overclocked your CPU, chances are that you've probably 
              stress tested your CPU. One of the more common ways to do so is to use Prime95, which is a tool used in the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS). <br />
              It's an entirely volunteers based collaborative project to search for Mersenne primes, which are prime numbers of the form 2<sup>p</sup>-1 where p is also prime, named after French mathematician Marin Mersenne.
              It just so happens that searching for these elusive primes is also a great way to test system stability. <br />

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-200 mb-4">Why Mersenne Primes Matter</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-4">
            You might be wondering, what's the point of finding these really, <em>REALLY</em> large primes, and that's a perfectly valid question.
            In fact, that's a question that I've also asked myself as well. And honestly, other than it's important for math research and it's a convenient way to reuse outdated hardware,
            I don't really know. <br />
            Frankly speaking, I am nowhere near enough qualified to tell you why Mersenne Primes matter to mathematics research, but they do, and fortunately, there are very qualified people who can explain to you <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/why_join/">why GIMPS matters</a>.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-200 mb-4">Get Involved</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-200 mb-4">
          Whether you're just someone who hates to have old, unused hardware wasting at home (like me, and you should look into <a href="https://frame.work/ca/en">Framework computers</a> if you haven't) or you're a mathematics PhD looking for meaningful ways to contribute to 
          mathematics research, the beauty is that anyone and (almost) any computer can contribute to GIMPS! <br />
          So if you want to give your hardware a second life, here's how to get started:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 text-gray-200 space-y-2">
          <li>Visit the <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/" className="text-indigo-300 hover:text-white" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official GIMPS website</a></li>
          <li>Download and install Prime95</li>
          <li>Create a free account to track your contributions (optional)</li>
          <li>Configure the software to use your preferred amount of system resources</li>
          <li>Start searching for primes and maybe earn a nice prize on the way!</li>
        </ol>
